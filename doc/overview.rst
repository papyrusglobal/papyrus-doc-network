* Fix transparency issues by creating decentralized storage of ad campaigns data with permissioned access and incentivizing market participants to store that data, decentralization protects data from manipulation
* Remove excessive and hidden budget cuts by allowing advertisers to make payments in tokens based on established payment conditions fixed in smart contracts, all supply chain participants receive payments according to smart contracts, smart contracts are executed using complete ad campaign information stored in decentralized storage
* Resolve brand safety, viewability and fraud issues by connecting auditors / antifraud vendors / attribution providers that verify ad traffic according to smart contracts and put verification information into decentralized storage, ad campaign payments are made automatically according to verification results, dispute resolution happens automatically
* Transition from ad blockers to value exchange with end users by providing tools to publishers to construct dialogue with users on value exchange, users can turn off ads and pay content subscription fees or engage with ads and receive compensations in the form of content access or tokens
* Less paperwork and organizational expenses on payments reconciliation and disputes resolution due to usage of token for payments and automation of processes via smart contracts
