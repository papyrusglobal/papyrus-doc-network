How to deploy my dApp from Ethereum to Papyrus Network?
-------------------------------------------------------

To migrate your smart contract from the Ethereum network or deploy new contract written especially for the Papyrus Network you need to have stake PPR tokens to have ~ 500t of the gaslimit.
All information regarding the stakes could be found in a separate section of our documentation - `Staking <https://papyrus-network.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/staking.html>`_
The easyest way to stake is using Papyrus Wallet. 
Stake your PPR equvalent of ~500t of gaslimit and you will be able to deploy your smartcontract in Papyrus Network.
