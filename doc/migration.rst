How to deploy my smart contract to Papyrus Network?
---------------------------------------------------

To deploy your smart contract in the Papyrus Network you need to have stake PPR tokens and receive ~ 500k of the gas limit.
All information regarding the stakes could be found in a separate section of our documentation - `Staking <https://papyrus-network.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/staking.html>`_

The easyest way to do a stake is by using Papyrus Wallet:
